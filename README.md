We propose the use of the GIM data to accomplish two tasks: 

1) We would like to develop a more robust prediction model of patient outcomes given presenting clinical characteristics. This model will importantly take into account the physician-generated correlation between variables, and not treat each variable as in independent variable. 

2) In patients that had poor outcomes, we will create an interpretable model that can help investigate reversible actions that could have resulted in better outcomes.
